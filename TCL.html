	<p>In 2019, IoT is a term that has been pushed to the forefront of technology. Smart home is a new field for everyone. Its design framework is vague and there is more room to expand and explore. While designing at TCL Industrial design center, my team and I were aiming to make product upgrades for C series Smart TVs. Our design goal was to make Smart TVs more valued.</p>

	<p>As a container-like object, TV does not directly interact with people. People interact with the media produced for TV. Therefore, the expression of "value" may focus on the interaction between two objects, between objects and their environment.
		We used Lotus Blossom Ideation Process and discovered some keywords of “value” and I mainly focused on three of them.</p>
	<p>-Soft make the TV softer through the use of fabrics and wooden materials</p>
	<p>-Airy Make the TV look less heavy through the use of acrylic materials in the base</p>
	<p>-Color Choose neutral colors and colors suitable for the environment, so the TV blends into the environment</p>
