		<p>Pictographs evolved from pictorial characters, unlike phonetic text pictographs which are ideographic.</p>
		<p>I reversed the ideographic text with the original graphic, and then reorganized the graphic with the current intention, thus completing the fusion of ancient Chinese characters with modern design.</p>
        <p>This is very obvious in the design of Beijing. Urban layouts are not the same in every country, and since ancient times Beijing has been a "井" layout. “Road” becomes an element in Beijing, and I first made "北京(Beijing)" back to a graphic and then integrated the road element into it. This one figure and this new figure form a new ideogram. Similarly, I incorporated chopsticks into the "家(family)” and red into “庆(celebration)”.</p>
