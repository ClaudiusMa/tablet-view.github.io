		<p>Elegance is one of my works in The Heritage Series of Chow Tai Fook. The Heritage Series is mainly based on the totem pattern in the Tang Dynasty in China, and uses the symbolic language to convey subjective feelings.</p>
		<p>Elegance originated from The Classic of Poetry, also Shijing. The craft in the middle is called Wu, which embodies reputation. You can see four big characters in the middle of Wu. They are small seal scripts. Our ancestors used this proverb to describe elegant women. The Wu is surrounded by Lotus and Phoenix, which are the symbols of nobleness and purity. I combine the symbolic language as a panegyric to women.</p>

		<p>Twirling is also one of my works in The Heritage Series of Chow Tai Fook. Inspiration originated from the parrots and flowers in the Tang Dynasty. In the context of ancient China, parrots often come together in pairs, and the meaning of twirling is to wish the couples love forever. Telling stories with symbols of arts and crafts is a form of Chinese design, and I like how crafts can share a story without words to people.</p>
